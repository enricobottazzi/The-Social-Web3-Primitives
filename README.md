# On-Chain Identity
A curated list of projects and open-source primitives that will shape the way people express and interact on web3.

## The Thesis

Today all your data/attestations/preferences/tastes are fragmented into an infinite number of platforms' private database. Imagine if in the physical world you had to change your name, your clothes, your taste, your memories, your friends and, more in general, your identiy, everytime you move from place to place: **That's web today**

In Web3 users can cryptographically assert their identity and publish verifiable content, and sites that host content don’t have the authority to change it, because the root of trust is in the data itself, not in where it is found.

In web3 all the faucets and expressive data of your personality are tied to your identity. Platforms are no longer owner of this data but must adapt around user-owned data and assets. 

The interoperable nature of the data primitives in web3 will improve our digital experience allowing us to seamlessly move from platform to platform with a backpack filled with experiences, assets and data. 

**Web3 can give digital assets physical properties with digital superpowers thanks to their programmability and composability**

Web3 social-based applications will eventually create better ways for people to express themselves, coordinate, connect and interact on the web.

## Projects

| Project Name     | Descrption      | Tech/Data Stack     | 
| -------------    | --------        |  --------    |
| [Lens Protocol](https://lens.dev/)        |  Composable, portable and user-owned social graph primitive. Users can create their NFT profile, publish content to this profile and follow each other. Developers can leverage the composability of the system to build application  | NFT - built on Polygon  |
| [Sismo](https://www.sismo.io/)            |  ZK badges for reputation aggregation and privacy preserving access control. These are Zero-Knowledge (ZK) attestations of facts imported from your other accounts (Ethereum, twitter or github).| Non-transferable NFT + circom ZK-Snarks circuits  |
| [Blueskyweb](https://blueskyweb.org/)     |  Independent Twitter spin-off. Focusing on re-building the social web by connecting disconnected silos and returning control of the social experience to users.  |  Not defined  |
| [Poap](https://poap.xyz/)              |  POAP are NFTs issued to celebrate a special event/experience. By minting these memories to the blockchain, collectors build a rich tapestry of tokenized experiences which unlock a world of possibilities  |  NFT - built on xDai  |
| [Disco](https://www.disco.xyz/)         |  Users profiles that aggregates attestations, data and credentials from web2 and web3 protocols. The goal is to bo beyond the on-chain world and use DID and verifiable credential to build a more rich, private and revokable data-backpack |  W3C DID  - built on ???  |
| [InterRep](https://kovan.interep.link/)   |  A system that allows DApps or services to verify users' reputation from Twitter, Github or Reddit without exposing their identities issuing attestation badges, more [info](https://jaygraber.medium.com/introducing-interrep-255d3f56682) |  NFT + ZKP  - built on Ethereum  |
| [ZekoBadges](https://github.com/enricobottazzi/ZekoBadges)  |  ZK-based NFT badges that represent one’s role in Discord. With these badges users can claim an NFT that represent their Discord role without actually having to disclose the association between your Discord ID and your Ethereum Address |  NFT + ZKP circom circuits  - built on Polygon  |
| [SelfID](https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/self-id/)|  Self.ID is a framework that makes it easy to build Web3 applications with Ethereum-based authentication and composable, user-centric data storage and retrieval.|  Ceramic + 3ID DID + 3ID Connect  |
| [Iden3](https://iden3.io/) |  Tech stack for self-sovereign identity. Its wallet app allows end-users to receive trusted claims and generate zkProofs for private access.|  Ethereum + ZKP circom circuits, Interoperability with DID and Verifiable Credentials standards from W3C  |
