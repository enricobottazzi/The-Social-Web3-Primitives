# The-Social-3.0-Primitives
A curated list of projects and open-source primitives that will shape the way people express and interact on the web.

## The Thesis ##

More expressive data are to be tied to someoneâ€™s identity. Today all your data/attestations/preferences/tastes are fragmented into an infinite number of platforms' private database. In web3 all these faucets are tied to your identity. Platforms are no longer owner of this data but must adapt around user-owned data and assets.

** Add a disegno here **

Given the interoperable nature of blockchain applications, this will lead to a cambrian explosion of web3 social-based applications. These applications will eventually create better ways for people to express themselves, coordinate, connect and interact on the web.

You have your attestatiom tied to a platform in the web2 world. In web3 world all your data and attestatioms and credential are tied to your self !
